# Project Overview

## Description

This is the repository of the OMG, or Olin Marketplace for Goods. It is a terminal-based online market trading platform that allows multiple users to remotely trade any virtual commodities such as Bitcoin, Etheruem, or Dogecoin. Users can post buy/sell orders, view current market demand/supplies of any selected goods, and view trading history.
